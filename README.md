# nyc-taxi-data-engieering-project

This is a short project that I personally participated from one of Darshil Parmar's free data engineering project. 
I would like to thank Darshil for putting efforts into creating this wonderful projects for people who are looking to transitioning into Data Engineering field. This project not onlys show how ETL works in action but also introduce tools like "Cloud Storage", "Compute Enginer", "BigQuery" from GCP as well as a data pipeline tool called "Mage". 

For those who stumble across this project and would like to know more. The project name is  "Uber Data Analytics" and you may find the video in the link below.

Before diving right into the ETL process, I have created a data model based on the NYC Taxi Data that you have find [here](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)

Once I have structured what the tables will look like then I started with the ETL process.
You may check the code [here](https://github.com/jerryttt929/nyc-taxi-data-engieering-project/blob/main/nyc-taxi-data-project.ipynb)


In the end, I have successfully ingested data into Google BigQuery and created a general dashboard from the data.
